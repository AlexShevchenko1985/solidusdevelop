He brings with him an astonishing wealth of knowledge in the crypto space, and he is a true champion of bitcoin and its underlying technology- Blockchain. He’s a laser-sharp, pragmatic businessman and visionary who has a deep respect for what we’re trying to achieve here at Solidus AI Tech. He’s also a philanthropist. And those are just some of the reasons why he is so highly respected in our industry. We’re very pleased to have him on board, and I have no doubt he will very soon have a significant impact here.”</p><p name="efa5" id="efa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Speaking about the investment, ‘The Bitcoin Man’ founder <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Herbert Sim</strong> said: “Solidus AI Tech eco-friendly High Performance Computing (HPC) data centre and its Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform where Governmental Authorities, Megacorps, SMEs, Professionals, Metaverse and Play2Earn projects will be able to purchase Artificial Intelligence services and High Performance Computing Power seamlessly with the AITECH token, is something that I foresee being widely received. The HPC infrastructure platform will power and address challenges, such as cost, speed, power consumption and security for trending technologies such as the metaverse world, and Play2Earn games. The company is also set to launch its very own Meta BattleBots NFT collection for their currently under development Play2Earn Metaverse game built on Unity’s latest Unreal Engine 5 which will be powered by our high performance computing data centre. An exciting roadmap and journey ahead.”</p><p name="8e1e" id="8e1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sim’s pedigree is impressive: a public, verified ‘blue tick’ figure across all major social media platforms — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram (by the handle of @HerbertRsim) in the Blockchain industry, Sim was global operations director at HUOBI, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world (in 2018, the company became a publicly listed Hong Kong company) and he was also Chief Marketing Officer of Russian digital asset trading platform — Cryptology. Sim led the business development team at Hong Kong-based Broctagon Fintech Group, which provides end-to-end blockchain solutions (including enterprise protocol development, crypto exchange setup and token listing services), deep institutional liquidity and comprehensive system security testing.</p><p name="db94" id="db94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition to his numerous philanthropic and professional achievements, Sim has an MBA from the University of Wolverhampton, UK, and a BA in Mass Communications from Oklahoma City University, USA.</p><p name="7480" id="7480" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">About</strong></p><p name="608e" id="608e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Founded in December 2017, Solidus Technologies started as a cryptocurrency mining ﬁrm with a particular focus on mining Ethereum (ETH) via GPU-based mining rigs. In the wake of the 2020 financial crash and the significant boost in demand for AI services, the company shifted its core focus to Artificial Intelligence and incorporated Solidus AI Tech to become the AI arm of the business. Solidus’ Artificial Intelligence infrastructure will enable Government Authorities, Megacorps, SME’s, Professionals, Metaverse and Play2Earn projects to purchase AI services and High Performance Computing Power. Solidus AI Tech is launching its eco-friendly AITECH token to operate seamlessly with their AI infrastructure. AITECH can be bought, staked or held.</p></div></div></section>
