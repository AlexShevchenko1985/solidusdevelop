Bloomberg estimates the market for online gamers and gaming hardware will surpass $400 billion in 2024, with social media and live entertainment making up the remainder.</p><p name="6719" id="6719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus AI Tech is currently in consultation with with a gaming company (yet to be announced) for the creation of a next-generation Play-to-Earn Metaverse platform game design, which will feature the company’s proprietary AI Meta BattleBots, all of which will be run from its state-of-the-art eco-friendly high-performance computing (HPC) centre.</p><p name="c22f" id="c22f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite the success of HPC, there are significant challenges that hinder its adoption on the Metaverse. Chief among these challenges is the high cost of running HPC. Solidus Technologies founder Paul Farhi said: “Companies will need to start making robust technology investments. At the very least they will need to prioritise the challenges they must address in their digital transformation. Typically, we’re talking about things like network performance and node speed, and energy inefficiencies… training of the AI models consumes a lot of energy. For example, when training a single model, nearly 300 metric tons of CO2 are produced, which is huge. And as the demand for HPC grows, so do CO2 emissions. There are other problems, too, such as inefficient use of data and data security breaches. Many organisations, unfortunately, don’t have a strong digital foundation so they’ll need to prioritise building a well-oiled, cost-effective digital engine to enable them to reap the rewards of the new environments and worlds.”</p><p name="c495" id="c495" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The International Data Corporation revealed that in 2020, 64.2ZB of data was created, captured or replicated. This figure is expected to increase to 180ZB by 2025. Of all the data created in 2020, just 10.6% was useful for analysis, and only about 44% of that was used (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Source: </em><a href="https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insights/technology/technology-trends-2022?c=acn_glb_technologyvisiogoogle_12935576&amp;n=psgs_0422&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw0umSBhDrARIsAH7FCoeq-FVdVJM3zZbASvpfm9y3Cg0E4fkV9UW3tzRjKGDKiOZK0k1RmQ8aAjXvEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" data-href="https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insights/technology/technology-trends-2022?c=acn_glb_technologyvisiogoogle_12935576&amp;n=psgs_0422&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw0umSBhDrARIsAH7FCoeq-FVdVJM3zZbASvpfm9y3Cg0E4fkV9UW3tzRjKGDKiOZK0k1RmQ8aAjXvEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Accenture</em></a>).</p><p name="d1cd" id="d1cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The challenges that are inherent in powering the Metaverse and Play-to-Earn gaming present a golden opportunity for Solidus AI Tech. This is because, increasingly, the answer to the myriad data conundrums can be found in immensely powerful high-performance computing. HPC is not new, but a combination of GPUs, ASICs and other purpose-built chips are extending the limits of HPC capabilities.</p><p name="8d43" id="8d43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Farhi said: “Solidus AI Tech is very well placed to meet these challenges. Our cheaper electricity costs and faster hardware mean that we can offer our services at a lower price point than our competitors. Our clients can pay in Fiat or our native AITECH token for additional discounts. And we offer military-grade encryption to ensure our clients receive the maximum possible security for their data.”</p><p name="75be" id="75be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All Solidus AI Tech partners will be hand-picked and will have to complete and pass KYB and KYC applications to be considered as official partners to its ecosystem. To apply to become a partner of Solidus AI Tech Ecosystem please go to our website for more details. <a href="http://www.ai-tech.io" data-href="http://www.ai-tech.io" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.ai-tech.io</a></p><p name="bba5" id="bba5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">About</strong></p><p name="9b72" id="9b72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Founded in December 2017, Solidus Technologies started as a cryptocurrency mining ﬁrm with a particular focus on mining Ethereum (ETH) via GPU-based mining rigs. In the wake of the 2020 financial crash and the significant boost in demand for AI services, the company shifted its core focus to Artificial Intelligence and incorporated Solidus AI Tech to become the AI arm of the business. Solidus AI Tech is headquartered in Dubai, operating under cryptocurrency licences. Solidus’ Artificial Intelligence infrastructure will enable Government Authorities, Megacorps, SMEs and Professionals to purchase AI services. Solidus AI Tech’s eco-friendly AITECH token operates seamlessly with its AI infrastructure. AITECH can be bought, staked or held.</p><p name="0455" id="0455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">For more information contact: admin@ai-tech.io</p></div></div></section>
