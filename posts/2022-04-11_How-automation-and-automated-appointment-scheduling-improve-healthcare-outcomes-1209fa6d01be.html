In the medical industry there’s a lot of uncertainty about when an appointment will be scheduled or if it gets changed at all because doctors have such narrow windows in which they’re available. Especially in these austere times that we live in.</p><p name="215f" id="215f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, with the support of modern systems you can allow patients to book their appointments online at a time that works for them and in a highly personalised way. Sharing proactive alerts and messages about changes adds to the functionality too. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3557" data-href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3557" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wait times</a> are already at record levels and improving time efficiency makes a significant difference to outcomes for patients — particularly in the case of emergencies. For instance, calendar availability can be mapped to skip the times where A&amp;E (accident and emergency) departments are typically beyond capacity. This will reduce the extent to which a department is stretched during busy periods.</p><p name="3e73" id="3e73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Benefits (of automated appointments and automation in medicine generally):</p><p name="fa4d" id="fa4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1 Recommendations</strong></p><p name="d8eb" id="d8eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Appointments that can be arranged sans hassle, help bolster the quality of customer service. Online scheduling is a brilliant way to improve experiences and lead to positive reviews and recommendations. This will help private providers get more custom too.</p><p name="8aaf" id="8aaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2 Patients have purchase choice</strong></p><p name="e52e" id="e52e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Healthcare is undergoing a sea change. Patients are no longer the only ones buying products to improve their health; even healthy people who want to maintain good lifestyles often purchase similar and regularly the same items.</p><p name="ef1a" id="ef1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The internet was a great place to buy PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. People bought everything from sanitizers and oximeters, as the virus raged on in the last couple of years.</p><p name="cbfd" id="cbfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Medical customers should be able to get all their questions answered in a timely manner. Whether it’s about price, expiry date or safety — patients will find what they need if it’s digitally accessible and automated, this instantaneous satiation of consumer queries makes for exemplary customer service.</p><p name="ab40" id="ab40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3 Reduced stress</strong></p><p name="96e1" id="96e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The stress of an appointment can be reduced with good customer service. Doctors and their staff need to ensure they provide patients — whether tot or not -with as calm an experience as possible.</p><p name="f609" id="f609" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Incorporating automation can really help with this goal. When a patient needs routine care, good customer service is what will make the difference. Imagine a hassle-free experience of buying medicine online or surveys that are accurate and help with self-diagnosis for common ailments. Suggestions aided by super-smart AI that intimately understands each person specifically — that’s the potential reality in just ten years time.</p><p name="db0f" id="db0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The end goal of <a href="https://www.proprofsdesk.com/blog/how-help-desk-software-improve-customer-service-in-healthcare/" data-href="https://www.proprofsdesk.com/blog/how-help-desk-software-improve-customer-service-in-healthcare/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">service design</a> is to ensure that the patient has all their questions answered and can enjoy having an overall stress-free experience, automation of appointments is a part of this.</p><p name="c87b" id="c87b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4 Follow Ups and next steps streamlined</strong></p><p name="fc6f" id="fc6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without regular follow-ups, health treatment customer service healthcare is incomplete; unlike many other industries where following up is often optional. That’s because many patients go through treatment and need some extra attention from their providers after it has ended to ensure that everything goes smoothly.</p><p name="dc60" id="dc60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Patients love hearing from companies and that they are cared about. You can make patients feel like the most important people in your life by taking time during follow-ups to answer any questions or share information with them. Doing this at scale however can be difficult, especially for small private medical practices like orthodontists, for example. Automation in terms of communication can be a godsend in such a scenario.</p><p name="a401" id="a401" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When patients give feedback during follow-ups, they feel important and realise that their opinions matter, this is another possibility with opening up more lines of communication.</p><p name="f70b" id="f70b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why</strong></p><p name="5816" id="5816" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Healthcare automation is an important trend in the medical world because it reduces time spent on repetitive tasks, which have been shown to be less stressful for nurses and doctors. While robots may take some jobs, there is boundless potential for artificial intelligence to help us out.</p><p name="cc37" id="cc37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Software will continue to play an ever more vital role in this process.</p><p name="06d5" id="06d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The technology employs the most advanced flows available and combines magnificently. Different ideas help monitor safety, security, and even the status of loved ones, often isolated in bed.</p><p name="7d25" id="7d25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Healthcare automation and automated appointments help BOTH providers and patients/recipients.</p><p name="46a0" id="46a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Helps providers</strong></p><p name="0fa6" id="0fa6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a marvel that we can now use modern contraptions such as high performance computing to advance medicine.
