Many companies that have something to do with technology have been building new technologies to support AI.</p><p name="f564" id="f564" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">About Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p name="7579" id="7579" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Artificial Intelligence utilizes machines and computers to mimic the human mind’s abilities by solving advanced problems and making decisions. It involves more enhanced and intelligent machines, such as robots, that incorporate machine learning mechanisms into their systems.</p><p name="63fe" id="63fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many technologists believe that one-day machines will run our world and be able to think and act like humans. Current AI technology integrates both machine learning and deep learning systems, where these algorithms are expected to make predictions or evaluations based on input data provided to them. AI continues to grow stronger with the introduction of new innovative systems and can be used for speech recognition, transportation, search engines, and more.</p><p name="325f" id="325f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Future of AI</strong></p><p name="e730" id="e730" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While Artificial Intelligence is just getting started in this technological revolution, more organizations are adopting it. Many firms believe in the positive future possibilities of AI technology and are incorporating it into their businesses to solve certain challenges.</p><p name="e09d" id="e09d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AI will continue to use emerging technology to bring better data-based results for organizations, thus improving their strategies and output. Many industries are utilizing AI, while others are yet to integrate it. AI can be used for medicine, automation, voice recognition, transportation, self-driving cars, natural language processing (NLP), education, business, and more. The opportunities with AI can be unlimited and beneficial for the human race; as technology evolves, so does AI and its potential. There is still more to be done with AI, especially in the world of blockchain technology and the metaverse. The future of tech is focusing more on High-Performance Computing systems, virtual reality, and the metaverse.</p><p name="cffe" id="cffe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">About Solidus AITECH</strong></p><p name="8dae" id="8dae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus Ai Tech Limited have completed the main build of their data centre which is based in Europe (Bucharest) and are ready to commence the installation of their HPC infrastructure. This will enable European companies to obtain their supercomputing power within the EU.</p><p name="2e4f" id="2e4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By operating in Bucharest, they have the benefit of low-cost electricity and fast internet speeds and via their Intellectual Property (IP) they expect to run at around 40% less power consumption than the industry average.</p><p name="1bec" id="1bec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AITECH is the Worlds first deflationary Artificial Intelligence token which will be used as a payment gateway to license Artificial-Intelligence-as-a-Service (AIaaS), Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and rent HPC power via their Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform.</p><p name="ec59" id="ec59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus will also launch a marketplace for software developers to launch Artificial Intelligence software applications for their users to license where the developers will benefit via a profit share model. AITECH is the token that powers the Solidus AI Tech ecosystem and can be used to purchase everything that is listed on the platform. Fiat currency transactions are converted to AITECH seamlessly on backend and are completed on the Blockchain with AITECH tokens.</p><p name="4f0b" id="4f0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus will accept traditional forms of payment such as Paypal or Credit Card and between 5%-10% of AITECH tokens used to purchase services on the platform will be burned as part of the deflationary token economy.</p><p name="eb40" id="eb40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They have the capacity to scale up operations and expect to quickly become the top EU HPC centre and in the global top 10 HPC centres.</p><p name="101b" id="101b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Artificial Intelligence and AITECH</strong></p><p name="3478" id="3478" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Artificial Intelligence is shaping the future in several industries and usage across all industries is rapidly accelerating. AI is already proving its worth and abilities with technologies like IoT, big data, robotics, machine learning, and many more. AITECH frimly believes that AI technology is just getting started with many high powered innovations to be introduced in the near future.</p><p name="2f23" id="2f23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">About<br>Founded in December 2017, Solidus Technologies started as a cryptocurrency mining ﬁrm with a particular focus on mining Ethereum (ETH) via GPU-based mining rigs. In the wake of the 2020 financial crash and the significant boost in demand for AI services, the company shifted its core focus to Artificial Intelligence and incorporated Solidus AI Tech to become the AI arm of the business. Solidus’ Artificial Intelligence infrastructure will enable Government Authorities, Corporations, SME’s, Professionals, Metaverse &amp; Play2Earn projects to purchase AI services. Solidus AI Tech is launching its eco-friendly AITECH token to operate seamlessly with their AI infrastructure.
