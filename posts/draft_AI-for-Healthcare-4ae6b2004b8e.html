In the medical industry there’s a lot of uncertainty about when an appointment will be scheduled or if it gets changed at all because doctors have such narrow windows in which they’re available. Especially in these austere times that we live in.</p><p name="cc8a" id="cc8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, with the support of modern systems you can allow patients to book their appointments online at a time that works for them and in a highly personalised way. Sharing proactive alerts and messages about changes adds to the functionality too. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3557" data-href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3557" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wait times</a> are already at record levels and improving time efficiency makes a significant difference to outcomes for patients — particularly in the case of emergencies. For instance, calendar availability can be mapped to skip the times where A&amp;E (accident and emergency) departments are typically beyond capacity. This will reduce the extent to which a department is stretched during busy periods.</p><p name="052a" id="052a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Benefits (of automated appointments and automation in medicine generally):</p><p name="6e1e" id="6e1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1 Recommendations</strong></p><p name="88f3" id="88f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Appointments that can be arranged sans hassle, help bolster the quality of customer service. Online scheduling is a brilliant way to improve experiences and lead to positive reviews and recommendations. This will help private providers get more custom too.</p><p name="90a1" id="90a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2 Patients have purchase choice</strong></p><p name="65c5" id="65c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Healthcare is undergoing a sea change. Patients are no longer the only ones buying products to improve their health; even healthy people who want to maintain good lifestyles often purchase similar and regularly the same items.</p><p name="06db" id="06db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The internet was a great place to buy PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. People bought everything from sanitizers and oximeters, as the virus raged on in the last couple of years.</p><p name="4e64" id="4e64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Medical customers should be able to get all their questions answered in a timely manner. Whether it’s about price, expiry date or safety — patients will find what they need if it’s digitally accessible and automated, this instantaneous satiation of consumer queries makes for exemplary customer service.</p><p name="7539" id="7539" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3 Reduced stress</strong></p><p name="15f8" id="15f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The stress of an appointment can be reduced with good customer service. Doctors and their staff need to ensure they provide patients — whether tot or not -with as calm an experience as possible.</p><p name="0ceb" id="0ceb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Incorporating automation can really help with this goal. When a patient needs routine care, good customer service is what will make the difference. Imagine a hassle-free experience of buying medicine online or surveys that are accurate and help with self-diagnosis for common ailments. Suggestions aided by super-smart AI that intimately understands each person specifically — that’s the potential reality in just ten years time.</p><p name="c8fc" id="c8fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The end goal of <a href="https://www.proprofsdesk.com/blog/how-help-desk-software-improve-customer-service-in-healthcare/" data-href="https://www.proprofsdesk.com/blog/how-help-desk-software-improve-customer-service-in-healthcare/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">service design</a> is to ensure that the patient has all their questions answered and can enjoy having an overall stress-free experience, automation of appointments is a part of this.</p><p name="5960" id="5960" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4 Follow Ups and next steps streamlined</strong></p><p name="5b53" id="5b53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without regular follow-ups, health treatment customer service healthcare is incomplete; unlike many other industries where following up is often optional. That’s because many patients go through treatment and need some extra attention from their providers after it has ended to ensure that everything goes smoothly.</p><p name="ac28" id="ac28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Patients love hearing from companies and that they are cared about. You can make patients feel like the most important people in your life by taking time during follow-ups to answer any questions or share information with them. Doing this at scale however can be difficult, especially for small private medical practices like orthodontists, for example. Automation in terms of communication can be a godsend in such a scenario.</p><p name="de28" id="de28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When patients give feedback during follow-ups, they feel important and realise that their opinions matter, this is another possibility with opening up more lines of communication.</p><p name="d4cd" id="d4cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why</strong></p><p name="37dc" id="37dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Healthcare automation is an important trend in the medical world because it reduces time spent on repetitive tasks, which have been shown to be less stressful for nurses and doctors. While robots may take some jobs, there is boundless potential for artificial intelligence to help us out.</p><p name="9ad2" id="9ad2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Software will continue to play an ever more vital role in this process.</p><p name="6fdb" id="6fdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The technology employs the most advanced flows available and combines magnificently. Different ideas help monitor safety, security, and even the status of loved ones, often isolated in bed.</p><p name="986a" id="986a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Healthcare automation and automated appointments help BOTH providers and patients/recipients.</p><p name="4001" id="4001" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Helps providers</strong></p><p name="2f3b" id="2f3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a marvel that we can now use modern contraptions such as high performance computing to advance medicine.

This will help practitioners avoid time wasted extracting it from previous records, while also ensuring that patients receive optimum care, with all necessary details at hand ad-hoc.</p><p name="2e29" id="2e29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2 Ordering</strong></p><p name="0a5a" id="0a5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ordering process is a difficult and time-consuming endeavor. With an HER machine, it takes multiple clicks to complete one order; however with the help of predictive AI technologies this can be reduced significantly.</p><p name="7565" id="7565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3 Billing</strong></p><p name="8ce0" id="8ce0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With AI, the billing process can be more efficient and timely. This allows providers to present bills in a shorter amount of time with greater customer satisfaction.</p><p name="8757" id="8757" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Helps patients</strong></p><p name="9e95" id="9e95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Health care automation is a win-win for patients and providers.</p><p name="8a93" id="8a93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1 Disease detection</strong></p><p name="3fc0" id="3fc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Early detection is key to slowing the progression of diseases. It allows for early treatment, which helps stop the progress of illnesses and ultimately prevents future health problems down the line. Technology has already directly skyrocketed human ability to combat now ancient afflictions. Automated technology places as large role in this, including the way that it causes increase interaction with providers to monitor people’s help more thoroughly and often throughout their lives.</p><p name="1884" id="1884" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Modern AI can detect lung cancer in the early stages and this is faster than trained radiologists can. With all of its benefits for healthcare, patients are able to enjoy better health and stronger quality of life, including more time with those they cherish.</p><p name="c24b" id="c24b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2 Speedy diagnostics</strong></p><p name="04c2" id="04c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The automated diagnostic process is more accurate and saves time because it delivers speedy results.</p><p name="669c" id="669c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Time can be crucial in diagnosis, especially with serious illnesses like cancer or some of the conditions brought about by diabetes, where a delay may mean the difference between life and death.</p><p name="716f" id="716f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3 Quality care</strong></p><p name="16de" id="16de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With automated dispensing machines in hospitals, you can avoid long queues and get the right drugs with no time. Technology can also reveal whether patients are sticking to care plans making it easier for physicians to intervene real-time; automation also boosts satisfaction among patients by reducing and eliminating arbitrary, slow, clunky processes.</p><p name="f89e" id="f89e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why Solidus</strong></p><p name="70ab" id="70ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Solidus AITECH blockchain operating system for the public sector is being built by an experienced team of developers.
