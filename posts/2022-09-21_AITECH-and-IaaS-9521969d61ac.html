Now, more than ever, the demand for advanced technological solutions has peaked, and Artificial Intelligence seems to be leading this movement.</p><p name="a9de" id="a9de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">About Solidus AITECH</strong></p><p name="63c3" id="63c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus Ai Tech is a computation network created to distribute computing power to organizations working on complex AI projects requiring high computing power. They are on a mission to build an eco-friendly High-Performance Computing (HPC) Data Centre and an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. They aim to assist Governmental Authorities, SMEs, Megacorps and Professionals by providing them with computing power and Artificial Intelligence Licensing services through our cryptocurrency token AITECH.</p><p name="a637" id="a637" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our vision supports the development of truly efficient data centres that can fulfill the need for computing power in the global market. AITECH intends to alter how computing activities are managed and performed when joined with scalable tools to help developers safely convey and monetize their applications.</p><p name="8e54" id="8e54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where Are They With The Current Data Centre?</strong></p><p name="dbb4" id="dbb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus Ai Tech have finished building the main Data Centre and are currently preparing to begin the installation of the HPC infrastructure based in Europe (Bucharest). Many European companies faced a big problem with the lack of HPC facilities, making them seek their supercomputing needs overseas. By building and basing the Data Centre in Europe, it made the process easier and more secure for companies to access their supercomputing needs. The long-term plan is to build additional data centres in Europe, thus increasing the revenue streams. Solidus Ai Tech’s facilities will be more efficient and lower in cost, consuming 40% less power than the industry average.</p><p name="fbd8" id="fbd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the primary goals is to build energy-efficient AI HPC Data Centres. Lowering computation costs will make applications like scientific calculation, CGI rendering, and machine learning more accessible.</p><p name="fc46" id="fc46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">High-Performance Computing (HPC) Power Services</strong></p><p name="643f" id="643f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The current AI market proves that there still exists poor awareness of the possibilities that AI can create. There is an inadequate capacity, a lack of high-quality data, a lack of AI competence centres, and overall limited availability of AI capabilities.</p><p name="8c2c" id="8c2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Potential use cases for Artificial Intelligence include medicine, cybersecurity, transportation, and the metaverse. For medicine, AI-customized treatment can help with drugs and treatments tailored to a person’s individual genome, lifestyle, and environment. For cybersecurity, AI-detected breach patterns can help detect malicious viruses &amp; programs before they can steal immense volumes of data. For transportation, AI-supported commuting will assist in the immersion of driverless trains, autonomous driving, and autonomous jetliners. For the metaverse, HPC power will be an important requirement to power play-to-earn games and metaverse. They will require high-performance computing power for their streaming solutions.</p><p name="608e" id="608e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How Far Can AI Go?</strong></p><p name="aefa" id="aefa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the long-term, Artificial Intelligence will benefit the economy, and its need for future creations will be realized. AI is effectively used for advanced computers and vehicles, among other services. Europe is not highly invested in AI compared to America. Still, AITECH plans to change the norm and provide HPC AI services all over Europe. Many machine learning applications use HPC Servers like image recognition, deep learning, real-time voice translation, and autonomous cars. HPC servers will allow machine learning to go further into the future, especially with the upcoming metaverse projects once they go live.</p><p name="4ce6" id="4ce6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">AI is one of the most remarkable technological transformations, it’s a growing revolution, and Solidus Ai Tech aims to become the leaders in the democratization of AI. We are building the technology that will make communities safer and more connected everywhere.
