With developments in AI, computing power and software, we can create realistic 3D worlds that we can inhabit and interact with. These are now typically known as being part of the metaverse. In this virtual space, we can play games, socialise and do business. The potential uses for the metaverse are endless. SMBs can use it to increase efficiency and reduce costs, while consumers can enjoy more immersive entertainment experiences. With the right tools and infrastructure in place, the metaverse will be a reality very soon.</p><p name="5125" id="5125" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What</strong></p><p name="8608" id="8608" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A supercomputer is a type of high-performance computer that can be used for many purposes. These computers have the ability to process large amounts of data in parallel and draw key insights from it with ease, making them valuable tools when searching or analysing vast quantities of information quickly, without losing quality and depth. In fact they’re much more than just this, they run the systems we depend on through our daily lives.</p><p name="2397" id="2397" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Think hospitals, emergency services, banks, shopping centres, network infrastructure and so on. The list is vast. This is only With us being at the start of the metaverse’s coming, experts have identified a massive deficit that will thwart its development. Computing power. It’s going to take some more technology than we currently have. <a href="https://singularityhub.com/2021/12/17/the-metaverse-will-need-1000x-more-computing-power-says-intel/" data-href="https://singularityhub.com/2021/12/17/the-metaverse-will-need-1000x-more-computing-power-says-intel/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intel</a> plans on being an integral part in making this future reality, with their recent release of information, proving that they are dedicated towards helping us all realise this grand vision.</p><p name="3d70" id="3d70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ​​metaverse is still a decade or so away, primarily because the required advances within computing power, networking, hardware and other supporting technology will take time to be developed. It looks as if developments will be in tandem with this and so it will become more sophisticated as time goes on.</p><p name="9776" id="9776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why</strong></p><p name="83ae" id="83ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the most interesting things about this new technology is that it will allow us to step out into a virtual world, where we can interact with others who share similar interests. This may sound like an elaborate departure from the truth, but it really isn’t. In fact, there are some really powerful implications for society as well.</p><p name="b0a2" id="b0a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The metaverse is coming. And it’s already causing a lot of headaches for tech companies. The world has never seen such vast amounts of data before — if this trend continues, we can expect major problems with our networks and storage facilities in the near future as they struggle to keep up. That’s where Solidus AI tech comes in, we can help be the support necessary for all sorts of companies across so many different sectors.</p><p name="c50c" id="c50c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Use Cases of AI In the Metaverse</strong></p><ol class="postList"><li name="ee08" id="ee08" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Avatar Creation</strong></li></ol><p name="35e7" id="35e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">AI helps you to design a compelling avatar, to accurately represent you, whether here that’s in or out of business or even both. It analyses the 2D sample images with 3D scanners and then formulates highly realistic simulated images that can be used as icons in today’s internet world.</p><p name="26ee" id="26ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The magic of AI is now able to produce highly realistic avatars from just a 2D sample image. It analyses your facial expressions, hairstyles and aging for an even better virtual experience.</p><p name="e297" id="e297" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Snapchatters are always on the go, and they need a way to stay connected with their friends. Snapchat provides this by creating 3D animated figures that represent users by approximately mirroring their features, crafting an accurate representation of them; their Snapchat avatar.</p><p name="a4e3" id="a4e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Digital Humans</strong></p><p name="96d1" id="96d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Digital humans are the 3D versions of chatbots. They’re almost similar to real live people in function, but thankfully they don’t quite match our intelligence yet.</p><p name="567a" id="567a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The metaverse is a digital world where humans live alongside virtual creatures. These intelligent semi-beings do require considerable computing power.</p><p name="12fd" id="12fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The metaverse is an emerging virtual world that could have a significant impact on how we work and play. In the future, digital humans could be used as NPCs in gameplay or automated assistants for VR workplaces, with several well-known companies like <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/" data-href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a> investing heavily in order to pioneer these developments.</p><p name="45cf" id="45cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The application of “digital beings” (or ‘NPCs’) within video games has become notoriously popular over time; these characters act like regular people but don’t always follow traditional rules so they can offer some kind assistance when needed. For instance — one might need help getting past certain obstacles.</p><p name="0e6a" id="0e6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3. World Expansion</strong></p><p name="cc79" id="cc79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The future of VR is up to AI. Engines that now exist can analyse data from past experiences and produce new results with each play through, making gaming or virtual interaction environments novel and ever-expanding on their own accord. Such massive amounts of information storage require powerful core computing centres to handle demand and ensure smooth performance for users across vast geographies.</p><p name="ea8b" id="ea8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4. Languages</strong></p><p name="3f66" id="3f66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Multilingual accessibility is when a computer or device has the ability to understand and translate between multiple languages. It’s an important feature that allows those who don’t speak the same language (or languages) easier understanding.</p><p name="b5c4" id="b5c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AI is the future of virtual communication across different language communities, bridging the gap between cultures. Already, It can convert any natural language into machine-readable formats, processing commands and then send them back in an original form. This whole process only takes place within seconds, just like having a real conversation with someone else who speaks your language perfectly. As you would probably guess, this requires more power than simple, automated language-processed subtitles.</p><p name="1dc5" id="1dc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5. Interfaces</strong></p><p name="420d" id="420d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Intuitive interfaces are expected these days. A lot of people willingly opt for these types of devices because they work just how you expect them to, without surprises or novel — and hence to be learned — operation. For example, when if wearing virtual reality headsets that can be operated using functions that are common to all other headsets and sensibly designed flow of operation i.e on, off, zoom, adjust, etc.</p><p name="b121" id="b121" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">AI will underpin the biggest opportunity that the metaverse brings</strong></p><p name="3923" id="3923" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That opportunity is play-to-earn. Yes, if you ever became a Colin McCrae millionaire, or accrued florins in a medieval strategy game this is sort of what we’re talking about here. This new space has helped some people who used to work day jobs quit their careers for full time enjoyment, earning them much higher salaries than when they were employed. While this isn’t a normal scenario, the potential of this future industry is hard to wrap one’s head around.</p><p name="70a5" id="70a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Home ownership, gaming NFT’s for exclusive non-fungible (i.e completely unique, unreproducable desirables) items are just the start. There could be virtual stock exchanges, insurances for items stored digital — essentially making a digital insurance industry out of thin air. The mind boggles at the infinite possibility that play-to-earn puts on the table.</p><p name="3f2d" id="3f2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gaining rewards in a P2E game is different depending on the platform. For example, Axie Infinity players can earn money by battling against monsters and other users as well as completing daily quests. A big feature is therefore cryptocurrency as many opt and wish to be paid this way, often because these currencies have a change of stratospheric appreciation. It’s also an option for players to get exposure to non-fiat currency, which many believe is a sensible option as the value of dollars and other currency declines more rapidly at this time — this century’s record high inflation. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e659559-c9b8-48fe-9f8f-590ae1cfed3b" data-href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e659559-c9b8-48fe-9f8f-590ae1cfed3b" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Janet Yellen recently announced the expected damage this will do.</a></p><p name="00b5" id="00b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Market Growth</strong></p><p name="c969" id="c969" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The market for supercomputers is expected to grow at a 9.5% annual rate over the next five years, driven by increasing adoption of cloud computing and AI-related technologies in tandem with growing needs within science and industry. Many are investigating datasets that can help them better understand how algorithms function based on human input sources like social media posts or transactions recorded online via credit cards, of which these are just two examples.</p><p name="41ac" id="41ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bloomberg has stated that they think that the market will be worth in excess of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/metaverse-may-be-800-billion-market-next-tech-platform/" data-href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/metaverse-may-be-800-billion-market-next-tech-platform/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">$800m, just two years from now</a> (in 2024).</p><p name="1389" id="1389" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook has been making moves to become the metaverse platform of choice for this new economy. Going so far that they are no longer <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59083601" data-href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59083601" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Facebook, they are Meta</a>. That’s a big, big bet. The Facebook user base and their investments in VR could give them an edge over competitors, while Unity and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home" data-href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic</a> may see heightened demand from gamers who want access through these platforms as well. This potential bodes well for investors, especially if more evidence supports this in the short and medium term i.e next few months.</p><p name="8c3f" id="8c3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The Solidus AITECH blockchain operating system is designed to simplify the infrastructure companies need and assist businesses and institutions which require large amounts of processing power. With this solution, augmented and virtual reality focused firms can improve efficiency by leveraging smart contracts that allow them access data from across different areas. <a href="https://ai-tech.io" data-href="https://ai-tech.io" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Visit the website to learn more.</a></p></div></div></section>
