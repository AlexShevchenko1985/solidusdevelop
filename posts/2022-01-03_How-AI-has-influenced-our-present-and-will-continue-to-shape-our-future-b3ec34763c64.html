The following sectors heavily rely on AI:</p><p name="9322" id="9322" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AI is currently widely applied in the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">healthcare</strong> industry for the analysis of suitable treatments. Taking into account the medical history of patients, this will be improved and expanded in the future. The biggest task AI will have in healthcare, is mining data.</p><p name="6df8" id="6df8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As of now, AI can understand and evaluate the most suitable treatments, yet for the future, it is predicted that AI will be able to identify patterns that enable the correct diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions, medical imaging, medication management, drug discovery, and even robotic surgery.</p><p name="86d1" id="86d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For diagnosis and treatment, AI will be combining its learnings from past patterns with the patient’s individual situation regarding the environment, past (medical) history, genes, and lifestyle. Solidus AI tech is building a blockchain operating system for the public sector, designed to deliver smart contracts including computation-intensive data analysis for the health sector.</p><p name="fdb5" id="fdb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AI-based tools in <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">cybersecurity</strong> are designed to look for and determine malicious viruses before data can be stolen. This is designed to prevent millions of security breaches yearly. Solidus AI Tech aims to make communities safer and more connected.</p><p name="15ca" id="15ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Robots are already widely adopted for <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">logistics and vital tasks</strong>. Many warehouses already use AI-powered robots to sort and package products. Furthermore, these robots can determine the quickest shipment route for express deliveries. AI in the logistic sector will further develop to robots being able to take over more and more tasks and potentially warehouses being predominantly run by them. Solidus AI Tech aims to replace work that evolves around vital and repetitive tasks with robots. This will especially be serving the elderly, as mowing the lawn, cooking or cleaning will be done for them.</p><p name="9397" id="9397" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">retail and commerce</strong> market is highly competitive, companies are constantly making an effort to find new patterns in consumer behavior to align their strategy accordingly. For example, the ads and recommendations one sees on websites of products or services are AI-powered. These are determined based on past information that has been collected from the consumer. Patterns and history detect what one would be most interested in, which is then presented to you.<br>AI is also frequently used for the customer experience journey. Chatbots oftentimes are powered by AI and later if that does not (yet) solve the issue customers are redirected to a person. Solidus AI tech serves data analysis information regarding this sector through the platform.</p><p name="4ece" id="4ece" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">transportation</strong> industry, AI-powered self-driving cars are being developed. The question is not if, but when the switch from manually driven cars to autonomous cars will occur. Furthermore, research is being conducted to schedule and regulate public transportation and traffic light management. Driverless trains are already widely spread in European cities, and the pilotless Boeing is currently being tested for approval. Solidus AI Tech will aid this sector by providing computation-intensive data analysis tasks.</p><p name="5716" id="5716" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first robotic tea maker, powered by AI and IoT, has already been designed for <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">food tech</strong>. Consumers can create their own recipes to watch the robot make their tea. Furthermore, AI is planned to be used for the industrial food processing sector. Tomra Systems ASA has designed an AI-based sorting system aiding with the automation of measuring the size, shape, and color of french fries or analyzing the fat content in meat.<br>The farming sector has already benefitted from AI through intelligent plucking machines. Currently, in the agricultural space, a company is using AI to measure the effect of UV light, salinity, heat, and water on crops in order to develop a method to design the perfect crops.</p><p name="7c8e" id="7c8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> banking and financial industry </strong>is also greatly benefiting from AI. Humans are being replaced by robots in terms of processing loan applications or even finding the right investment decisions for clients in split seconds.<br>For insurance companies, AI is helping to determine the best insurance plan or even for the processing of filed claims. Moreover, AI is helping with fraud detection as it can sift a lot of information in little time and detect patterns associated with malicious viruses.</p><p name="da22" id="da22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are just a few of the examples where AI is currently embedded. A lot of jobs have already been replaced by advancements in AI, especially standardized processes or ones that require sifting through a lot of knowledge and deducting a decision from it.</p><p name="fe2f" id="fe2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As AI is ever advancing increasingly more jobs will become obsolete. For example, the autonomous Boeing that is being tested and hence will not be needing any pilots anymore. Warehouses and repetitive tasks of any kind will be predominantly run by robots. Robots are especially appreciated for replacing tasks with physical activity. Furthermore, as they are very time efficient knowledgeable, tasks that require the determination of a solution based on a lot of knowledge can be done by AI-powered robots as well.</p><p name="9662" id="9662" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The adoption of robots and their overtaking of various tasks will result in a lower cost for services as human labor expenses will decrease. For example, the innovation of a pilotless plane is forecasted to save airlines $38 billion over two decades, which will hence also result in a cheaper service for customers.</p><p name="12a1" id="12a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus AI Tech will have a platform where it is serving the data analysis tasks in the following areas: Self-Driving Cars, Face &amp; Voice Recognition, Health Care, Recruitment, Sales Automation &amp; Lead Generation, Virtual Assistants, Traffic Congestion / Smart Cities,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>Border Control / Secure Societies, Agriculture — Greenhouse Automation.</p><p name="68fb" id="68fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">About Solidus AI Tech</strong></p><p name="3fb8" id="3fb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus AI Tech is a tech company that is bridging the gap of insufficient High-Performance Computing resources in Europe by building data centers throughout Europe. One facility in Budapest has already been built and Solidus AI Tech is commencing to build an HPC infrastructure.</p><p name="0dc9" id="0dc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus AI Tech will build the technology that will enable communities to feel more connected and safe and henceforth become the leader of the democratization of AI.</p><p name="17b4" id="17b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://ai-tech.io/" data-href="https://ai-tech.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/AITECHio" data-href="https://twitter.com/AITECHio" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/yfdo6b56Ueg3NThk" data-href="https://t.me/joinchat/yfdo6b56Ueg3NThk" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AITECHtoken/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AITECHtoken/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/solidus-ai-tech-ltd/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/solidus-ai-tech-ltd/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aitechtoken/" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/aitechtoken/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoiPKK4VkbngPGw4mHqCKQ" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoiPKK4VkbngPGw4mHqCKQ" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Youtube</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Solidus-Ai-Tech-100121909056613" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/Solidus-Ai-Tech-100121909056613" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p></div></div></section>
