Advanced technology has been the focus of many institutions these last few years. The future is almost here, and both blockchain technology and artificial intelligence are highly needed for advanced systems, Web3 and the metaverse.</p><p name="5caa" id="5caa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)?</strong></p><p name="a1e7" id="a1e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cloud computing that offers essential storage, computing, and on-demand networking services is called Infrastructure as a Service IaaS. Transferring your company’s infrastructure to an IaaS solution is very beneficial to your company as it helps in reducing electricity and maintenance costs. IaaS solutions are very cost-effective regarding data centers, hardware, and IT resources. They help you avoid any complications in purchasing and managing physical servers.</p><p name="e170" id="e170" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Applications of IaaS</strong></p><p name="9f23" id="9f23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">IaaS services support a number of applications that include and are not limited to network firewalls &amp; security, servers &amp; storage, operating systems, database management, development tools, business analytics, data centres, and hosted applications. IaaS services help you run new applications efficiently and expand the dependability of your underlying infrastructure.</p><p name="4949" id="4949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">About Solidus Ai Tech</strong></p><p name="2bd8" id="2bd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solidus Ai Tech was established to provide companies working on complicated AI projects with high-performance computing power as required. AITECH is working to achieve its goal of building an eco-friendly High-Performance Computing (HPC) Data Centre and an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. The company aims to assist the public and defense sectors by providing them with HPC and AI licensing services through blockchain technology.</p><p name="d289" id="d289" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">AITECH’s Competitive Advantages as an IaaS Company</strong></p><p name="03be" id="03be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AITECH tops other competitors due to its strategic location, Romania, Bucharest, a country with the fastest internet connection in the world. Romania is also home to the top engineers in the global IT industry. Operational costs are so low, which allows AITECH to sustain a long-term commitment to its customers.</p><p name="23b0" id="23b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AITECH’s cost-effective environment allows it to pass down discounts to its clients, offering them cheaper services than their competitors. AITECH plans to create an option for companies to purchase its services in crypto and fiat currency, which will be more appealing to those using blockchain and web3 technology. Giving clients more than one paying option leads AITECH one step ahead of its competitors and gives it a bigger audience.</p><p name="6504" id="6504" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AITECH can differentiate itself from the competition thanks to its various software solutions operating on its HPC infrastructure. AITECH’s infrastructure is compatible with Hardware resources, so the optimization works towards the best price efficiency at maximum power.</p><p name="af7b" id="af7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AITECH will seize the HPC market, beginning with the public and defense sectors, as commercial engagements are already underway with clients from NATO member countries.</p><p name="dfd5" id="dfd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While also the customer portal will allow registration for new users and account enrollment for the retail and B2B customers.</p><p name="26d7" id="26d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">AITECH’s Service Cost Compared to Competitors</strong></p><p name="0049" id="0049" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AITECH’s top competitors are Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. The average cost of IaaS services with any of AITECH’s competitors can reach up to 980 EUR per month of GPU power. AITECH’s average monthly cost is around 590 EUR, a major difference in terms of cost-effectiveness.</p><p name="aa29" id="aa29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What breakthroughs will AI &amp; HPC Services Accomplish?</strong></p><p name="9823" id="9823" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Artificial intelligence will lead the future of technology with its significant breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity, especially in health care and the medical sector. AI can now be used for medical drugs and treatments, cybersecurity, transportation, voice recognition, web3, and the metaverse. Artificial intelligence can create incredible possibilities for the future of the human race.</p><p name="c1b0" id="c1b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The need for High-Performance Computing services along with Artificial Intelligence is starting to be realized by many organizations, as the future may depend on it. AITECH has established its first HPC Data Centre in Europe, providing the cheapest IaaS services imaginable. The company will prove to be the top AI service company in the region.
